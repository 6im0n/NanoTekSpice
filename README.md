# NanoTekSpice

NanoTekSpice is a project developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming module at Epitech. The objective of this project is to implement a digital electronic simulator using C++.

## Usage

To compile the program, use the provided Makefile with the following command:

```bash
make
```

This will generate an executable named `nanotekspice`.

To run the simulator, execute the following command:

```bash
./nanotekspice [circuit_file.nts] [input_values]
```

Replace [circuit_file.nts] with the path to your circuit file and [input_values] with the initial values for the inputs. The simulator will then display the results of the simulation.

## Features

The program supports the following features:

- Simulation of digital electronic circuits.
- Parsing of circuit files in a specific format.
- Dynamic handling of various components like AND, OR, XOR gates, flip-flops, etc.
- Ability to set initial input values for simulation.

## Circuit File Format

The circuit file should follow a specific format. Refer to the provided examples for guidance.
